The _theme of the book_ is the _problem of how to assign a size, content, probability, or other measure to certain sets_.

The verbs associated with this task are _count_, _measure_, and _calculate_. All these verbs are done _with respect to some base unit_.

**well-definedness**. Independence of a _concept_ (e.g. area) from the choices made to _calculate_ it (e.g. choosing the base line and corresponding height).

Reasonable expectations to have of a measure $\mu$ are:
1. well-definedness,
2. takes on values in $[0, \infty]$, and
3. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$.
4. additivity, i.e. $\mu(A \sqcup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B)$
5. $\sigma$-additivity (for arbitrary shapes, e.g. circles), i.e.

$$
\mu(\underset{j \in \N}{\bigsqcup} A_j) = \underset{j \in \N}{\sum} \mu(A_j)
$$

_Invariance under congruences_ turns out to be a special property of length, area, and volume, i.e. **Lebesgue measure on $\R^n$**.

Properties (1), (2), (3) and (5) are the essential motivations for the formal definition of a **measure**.
