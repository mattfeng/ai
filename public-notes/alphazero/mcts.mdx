**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a method for making optimal decisions in artificial intelligence problems, typically move planning in combinatorial games. It combines the _generality of random simulation_ with the _precision of tree search_.[^about]

MCTS can theoretically be applied to _any domain_ that can be described in terms of $(\text{state}, \text{action})$ pairs and _uses simulation_ to forecast outcomes.

## The basic algorithm

Build a search tree (node by node) according to the outcomes of simulated playouts.

1. **Selection.** Starting at root node $R$, recursively select **optimal child nodes** until a leaf node $L$ is reached.
2. **Expansion.** If $L$ is not a **terminal node** (i.e. the game is not over), then create one or more child nodes and select one called $C$.
3. **Simulation.** Run a simulated playout from $C$ until a result is achieved.
4. **Backpropagation.** Update the current move sequence with the simulation result.

A **node** must contain:
1. a value estimate $v_i$ based on simulation results
2. the number of times $n_i$ the node has been visited

The **optimal child node** is usually selected using the **Upper Confidence Bound** formula ($C$ is a tunable parameter, $N$ is the total number of times that the child's parent has been visited):

$$
v_i + C\sqrt{\frac{\ln N}{n_i}}
$$

## Benefits
- _Aheuristic._ the algorithm does not rely on domain knowledge.
- _Asymmetric._ the algorithm adapts to the topology of the search space.
- _Anytime._ the algorithm can be halted at anytime the current best estimate.
- _Elegant._ the algorithm is simple to implement.

## Drawbacks
- _Weak playing strength._ In its basic form, MCTS can fail to find reasonble moves for medium complexity games within a reasonable amount of time.
- _Slow convergence._ MCTS requires many rollouts to converge to a good solution.
